# My Thought process

I would encourage you to go through each commit for each question, even if it is
just to read the comments.  Comments are some of the things that went through my
head, and a way for me to track issues.

I was told the purpose of this tech test is to see how I think.  So I've documented my thoughts in README.md files as well as comments and commits.
